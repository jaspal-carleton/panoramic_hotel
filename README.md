# Panoramic Hotel Booking App

After the contagious pandemic is over, Panoramic Hotel is now accepting booking of its only presidential suite. This Panoramic Hotel Booking App provides RESTful APIs with which the guests can book, view, or delete their hotel booking. 

## Description

This Panoramic Hotel Booking App is a headless app, which means there is no UI to interact with. The HTTP requests to the app can be made using CURL, Postman, or other similar tools. The response to the RESTful API request is provided in JSON format. The app is fundamentally built using NodeJS and ExpressJS.
